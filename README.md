# Simple-Web-App
Simple Setup for Generic Hackathon Website (PWA, Node &amp; Express from Single Server, Bootstrap, Side Menu)

Generic Simple Site
 - Open source content where ever possible
 - Start from Express Generator with handlebars.  
 - Add Bootstrap
 - Add Bootstrap Side Menu 
 - Progressive Web App 
 - Generic JS Chart
 - Simple JSON file for quick simple data store
 - Fully responsive
 - Single server for client distribution and API calls
 
Everytime I go to a Hackathon, I wish I had such a tool ready to go. 

Obviously 1 weak link in this outline is the datastore.  
Cross that bridge when we get to it... Mongodb, MySQL, data-store, SimpleStore, LowDB, LokiJS, etc...

Things I'd like to see:
 - Promise chain
 - Async/Await chain
 - REST API calls, with CRUD (Create , Read , Update , Delete) functions
 - Ajax call
 - Form Submit with Fetch and FormData
